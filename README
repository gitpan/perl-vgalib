plsvgalib v0.04 (c)1998 scottvr@netcomi.com
- perl version of svgalib for linux. 


INSTALLATION:

On a linux box, untar this into its own directory.
(if you run some old version of perl, you may need to
untar it into the source tree.. )
run the following commands (as root):
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

then, you should be able to tun the testvga.pl file
and start writing your own perl graphics programs! w00p!
Have fun porting your favorite C games.. ;)
